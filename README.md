# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection-Project
The objective of this project is to build a machine learning-based fraud detection system for a financial organization to ensure their customers' security and confidence. The model will analyze customer transaction data to identify and prevent fraudulent activities,providing advantages over traditional fraud detection methods such as quick real-time detection, efficient verification procedures, and the ability to uncover hidden relationships in the data. The model will be trained on a dataset containing transaction information and labels indicating whether the transactions are fraudulent or legitimate, and the task is to classify these transactions based on the provided data.The problem is significant because false positive fraud detections can result in inconvenience for customers, while false negatives can result in monetary losses for the credit card company.
